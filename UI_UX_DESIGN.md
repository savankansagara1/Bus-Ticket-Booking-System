# UI / UX DESIGN (Prototype Logic)

## Booking Flow Steps

### 1. Route Selection
- User selects the route: Ahmedabad → Mumbai
- Optionally, user selects intermediate stations (dropdown or list)
- "Next" button proceeds to seat selection

### 2. Seat Selection (Sleeper)
- Display bus seat map (grid layout)
- Available seats: clickable
- Booked seats: disabled/greyed out
- User selects one sleeper seat
- "Next" button proceeds to meal selection

### 3. Meal Selection
- Mandatory step: user must select a meal option
- Display meal choices (radio buttons or cards)
- "Next" button proceeds to booking confirmation

### 4. Booking Confirmation
- Show summary: route, seat, meal
- Display booking confirmation prediction (percentage)
- "Confirm Booking" button finalizes booking
- Show success/failure message

## Wireframe Instructions (Figma)

- Use simple rectangles and text for layout
- Stepper at top: Route → Seat → Meal → Confirm
- Each step on a separate frame/page
- Use color to indicate active/inactive elements
- Seat map: grid of rectangles, color-coded
- Meal selection: horizontal cards or radio buttons
- Confirmation: summary box, prediction bar, confirm button
- Error messages: red text below relevant fields

## UX Principles
- Minimal steps, clear navigation
- Disable actions until required fields are filled
- Immediate feedback for errors
- Clean, readable fonts and spacing
- Mobile-friendly layout

**Note:** Wireframes should be created in Figma using the above instructions for each step. Use placeholder images and text as needed.
